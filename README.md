Built off the [World of Warcraft Armory](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/) API, RBGHub is designed to let players do a mass-armory of a raid group. 

It is best used in conjunction with the [ListPlayers add-on](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22058-ListPlayers.html) to quickly copy and paste a group of names and then enter it into the search box. Afterwards, a detailed display of all raid members (either your team or the enemy's) will appear allowing you to pinpoint weak links in their team and make better informed decisions on how to play.
